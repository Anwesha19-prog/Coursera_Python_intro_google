# NYC Taxi Data Analysis - Automatidata Project

## Subtitle: Riding the Data Wave: Predictive Insights from NYC's Taxi Trails

### Project Overview

This repository contains the work from the Automatidata project, part of the "Getting Started with Python" course by Google on Coursera. The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) partnered with Automatidata to develop predictive models to estimate taxi fares before rides commence. The project focuses on transforming vast datasets into strategic business insights.

### Contents

- **Dataset**: Raw data from the New York City TLC, detailing taxi and limousine operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documentation of the data preparation and cleaning process, including data type verification, descriptive statistics, and exploratory data analysis.
- **Portfolio**: A detailed summary of insights gained, methodologies applied, and next steps in predictive analysis.

### Background on Automatidata

Automatidata specializes in converting stored data into solutions for clients, such as performance dashboards and strategic insights. Their expertise aligns data-driven strategies with business goals, ensuring efficient, impactful outcomes.

### Key Insights

- **Data Structuring**: Building a structured dataframe for TLC data, focusing on organization and readiness for analysis.
- **Data Type Analysis**: Ensuring accurate data types for effective analytical processes.
- **Statistics Gathering**: Descriptive statistics highlighted critical patterns and trends in the dataset.

### Issue and Problem

The primary challenge was converting high-volume operational data into a format suitable for regression modeling, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.

### Response and Feedback

Utilizing Python and pandas, we structured and analyzed the data, with regular feedback sessions enhancing approaches and aligning with project goals.

### Details of the Work

- **Data Preparation**: Construction of a dataframe, data cleaning, examination of types, and statistical analysis.
- **Communication**: Progress and findings communicated in executive summaries for stakeholders.

### Next Steps

1. **Deep Data Analysis**: Continued exploration into data patterns for model development.
2. **Model Construction**: Establish regression models for fare estimation and their validation.
3. **Visualization Development**: Build dashboards for clear representation of insights.
4. **Portfolio Expansion**: Consolidate learnings and outputs into a comprehensive GitHub portfolio.
